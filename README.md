# **Running Notebook Locally**
These are simple steps to run the notebook locally. 
Jupyter is required.

## 1. **Clone the Project Locally**
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mbeps/Machine-Learning-Labs-Questions.git
```

## 2. **Set Up Environment**

### Using Anaconda (Preferred)
If you have Anaconda installed, create a new environment and activate it. Once active, install the required packages.

### Using Poetry (Alternative for non-Anaconda users)
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. If you are using Poetry and do not have Anaconda, install the dependencies:
```sh
poetry install
```

## 3. **Run the Project**
After setting up the environment and installing all dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory and run the main notebook. 

> Note: Adjust the specific steps, commands, or any other requirements based on the nature of your project or any additional configurations that might be needed.
